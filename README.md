# Docker-Study-Notes

**Greetings! Now that I'm finally wrapping up my Linux essentials studies, I'll be moving over to Docker for a while. Realistically, I'll be studying Python in January but I'll be doing Docker here and there to get the hang of it. It's interests me more than Python but less than Terraform. I think I need to start here first though. So once again, I'll be publicly documenting my notes. I hear Cloud and DevOps jobs rely heavily on Docker so we need to learn this too! I won't be taking any certifications for this as of yet.
